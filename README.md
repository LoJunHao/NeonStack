Mixing the classic, frantic strategy of Tetris with the high-stakes adrenaline of gambling is a fascinating (and potentially dangerous) concept. To make this work, we have to move beyond just "playing Tetris for money" and introduce mechanics that reward both skill and calculated risk.

Let's call it: **Neon Stack: High Stakes.**

## 🕹️ Core Gameplay: The "Cash-Out" Mechanic

The game functions similarly to "Crash" style gambling games, but your survival depends on your stacking speed and efficiency rather than a random curve.

1. **The Buy-In:** You set your stake (e.g., $10).
2. **The Multiplier:** As you clear lines, your payout multiplier grows.
3. **The Risk:** The speed (Gravity) increases every 10 lines. If you **"Top Out"** (reach the top of the board), you lose your entire stake.
4. **The Exit:** You can hit the **"Cash Out"** button at any time between piece placements to walk away with your current winnings.

## 💰 Payout Structure

In this design, "T-Spins" and "Tetris" clears aren't just for points—they are massive multiplier boosters.

| Line Clear Type | Multiplier Increase |
| --- | --- |
| **Single** | +0.1x |
| **Double** | +0.3x |
| **Triple** | +0.7x |
| **Tetris (4 Lines)** | +2.0x |
| **T-Spin Double** | +1.5x |
| **Back-to-Back Bonus** | +0.5x (Consecutive Tetris/T-Spins) |

> **Example:** You start with a $10 bet (1.0x). You clear two Tetrises back-to-back. Your multiplier is now . You can cash out for $55 or keep going for the 10x.

## 🎲 The "Gamble" Features

To keep the "gambling" feel alive beyond just skill, we add high-risk elements:

* **The "Hold" Tax:** Using the "Hold" slot to save a piece costs a small percentage of your current multiplier. It’s a literal price for safety.
* **Side Bets:** Before the game starts, you can place side bets on the RNG:
* *"Drought Bet":* Bet that an I-piece (the long bar) won't appear for 20+ turns.
* *"Color Flush":* Bet that the next 3 pieces will all be the same color.


* **Garbage Attacks:** In a "PvP" gambling mode, players can bet against each other. Clearing lines sends "garbage" to the opponent. The winner takes the total pot minus a house rake.

## 🛡️ Fairness and The "House Edge"

To ensure the house doesn't lose to Tetris Grandmasters, the game utilizes:

1. **Aggressive Gravity:** After level 15, the speed becomes "20G" (pieces appear instantly at the bottom), forcing a natural end to the game.
2. **Provably Fair RNG:** The sequence of pieces is generated via a seed that the player can verify after the round, ensuring the "long bar" wasn't withheld just to make them lose.

## ⚠️ A Note on Design

Since we’re merging a skill-based video game with real-money stakes, the "tilt" factor is real. Unlike a slot machine where you just press a button, losing in **Neon Stack** feels personal because it's a "skill issue." The UI should be clean and high-contrast, but with prominent "Responsible Play" toggles.
